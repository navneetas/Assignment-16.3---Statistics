# Assignment-16.3---Statistics
Problem: 
In a class on 100 students, 80 students passed in all subjects, 10 failed in one subject, 7 failed in two subjects and 3 failed in three subjects. Find the probability distribution of the variable for number of subjects a student from the given class has failed in.'

Solution:

For a random student,

The probability of failing in 0 subjects, P(X=0) = 80/100 =0.8

The probability of failing in 1 subjects, P(X=1) = 10/100 =0.1

The probability of failing in 2 subjects, P(X=2) = 7/100 =0.07

The probability of failing in 3 subjects, P(X=3) = 3/100 =0.03
